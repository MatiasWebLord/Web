          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <p>
            Smoking is a leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality
            worldwide. Tobacco smoking causes annually 6 million deaths
            worldwide and is projected to exceed 8 million by 2030, according to
            statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO)1. Smoking was
            identified as the most important cause of preventable morbidity and
            premature death2. This ratio is estimated to increase to 10 million
            in 20–30 years. Due to tobacco use, the morbidity rate is 70% in
            developing countries, and these countries are the ones in which
            problems due to epidemic tobacco use are mostly seen3-5. The WHO
            estimates the number of smoking individuals as 1.1 billion,
            globally. A total of 700 million male smokers are located in
            developing countries, and 47% of men and 12% of women smoke a total
            of 6 trillion cigarettes a year worldwide5. According to the Global
            Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS) conducted in 2001, in five Arab
            countries in the Middle East, approximately 10% of youths (13–15
            years of age) use different kinds of tobacco products6. On the other
            hand, a recent study on smoking among Arab-American adolescents
            found that 26.6% of the studied sample smoked waterpipes7,
            emphasizing the increasing trend of this form of smoking among Arab
            youths. In Lebanon and Jordan, studies have reported that the
            prevalence of waterpipe smoking was more common than cigarette
            smoking among university students8,9. A household survey conducted
            by the WHO in some Arab countries in 2012 stated that the prevalence
            of smoking any tobacco product among those aged ≥15 years in 2009
            was 24% and 1% in the KSA, 46% and 31% in Lebanon, 47% and 6% in
            Jordan, 35% and 4% in Kuwait, 34% and 8% in Bahrain, 58% and 5% in
            Tunisia, and 35% and 11% in Yemen, among males and females,
            respectively10. Based on the Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS)
            conducted on the population aged ≥15 years in Qatar in 2013, the
            results indicated that the prevalence of waterpipe use was 4.9% and
            1.6% among males and females, respectively11. On the other hand, a
            report from the WHO on the global tobacco epidemic, conducted on the
            population aged 15 years or more in Yemen in 2017 concluded that the
            estimated prevalence of smoking was 18.7% among both sexes12.
            However, the prevalence of smoking, especially among university
            students, is largely unknown in many of these Arab countries,
            including Yemen, and to the best of our knowledge, no student-based
            survey has been conducted on the prevalence of smoking and its
            associated factors in the rural area of Hajja, Yemen. The goal of
            the study is to determine the ratio, attitudes and associated
            factors of smoking among college students in the rural area of
            Hajja, Yemen.

            marijuana and hashish, but the act is most commonly associated with
            tobacco as smoked in a cigarette, cigar, or pipe. Tobacco contains
            nicotine, an alkaloid that is addictive and can have both
            stimulating and tranquilizing psychoactive effects. The smoking of

          <h1>History</h1>
          <p>
            In order to explain why enormous sections of the world’s population
            continue to smoke, given the overwhelming medical evidence of its
            dangerous effects, one must understand the social history of the
            practice, the role of smoking in everyday cultural practices, and
            the meaning that people attach to it. Historian Jordan Goodman has
            argued that societies in which tobacco has been introduced have
            demonstrated a “culture of dependence,” be it in the ceremonial
            rituals of Native American culture, the fiscal policies of early
            modern states, the coffeehouses of 18th-century Europe, or the
            physical and psychological addictions associated with the cigarette.
            This dependence is one of the reasons individuals—and societies as a
            whole—are aware that smoking is harmful yet continue to smoke
            because of the individual and communal pleasures it brings. Smoking
            might represent folly and foolhardiness, but its intangible
            qualities still encourage millions to smoke. A cigarette is the
            perfect type of a perfect pleasure. It is exquisite and it leaves
            one unsatisfied.

          <h1>Types of Smoking</h1>
          <p>
            Different types of smoking do not eliminate its risk. And smoking,
            regardless of what type it is, still represents one thing, which is
            addiction, disease, ailments, early death and a waste of life and
            money. 1.Cigarettes Cigarettes are the most common way of consuming
            tobacco, especially among young people. A young person starts by
            trying a cigarette and then finds themselves addicted to nicotine,
            which is then hard to give up. There are several types of cigarettes
            that differ in shape but they all harm in the same way 2.cigars or
            Pipes Contrary to popular opinion, smoking cigars or pipes is no
            less harmful to health than smoking cigarettes. The truth is that
            one cigar on average has more nicotine and tar than a pack of
            cigarettes and one large size cigar has 40 times the nicotine and
            tar found in one cigarette. The concentrated toxic substances and
            carcinogens in cigars means that regular cigar smoking is harmful,
            even in a small amount. 3. Shishas or Hookahs and Mouassal It is
            commonly thought that smoking shisha and hookah can be less harmful
            than cigarettes, but the truth is that one shisha is equivalent to
            50 to 60 cigarettes, and a two hour to three hour session of smoking
            a shisha is equivalent to smoking 25 cigarettes. There are several
            types of shisha that differ in shape and content, but its harmful
            effects are the same. One type is “mouassal” which is molasses
            tobacco, another is “jrak” which is tobacco added to a group of
            rotten fruits and the sweetened shisha which contains tobacco and
            specials kinds of fruits like apricot. 4.ring or Chewing Tobacco in
            the Mouth Chewed and smoke-free tobacco is consumed through the
            mouth; it is smoking without the smoke. The person chews the tobacco
            – mixed with other ingredients – in their mouth for a sustained
            period of time where the juice from the tobacco is absorbed to the
            bloodstream and hence to the rest of the body. The effects on the
            body are much the same as smoking. The user can also store it in the
            mouth cavity without chewing for the same result. This way of
            consuming tobacco is no less dangerous than smoking.

          <h1>Vaping Vs Smoking</h1>
          <p>
            Vaping is less harmful than smoking, but it's still not safe.
            E-cigarettes heat nicotine (extracted from tobacco), flavorings and
            other chemicals to create an aerosol that you inhale. Regular
            tobacco cigarettes contain 7,000 chemicals, many of which are toxic.
            The difference between smoking and vaping is that smoking delivers
            nicotine by burning tobacco, which can cause smoking-related
            illnesses, and vaping can deliver nicotine by heating a liquid in a
            much less harmful way.

            The top producers of tobacco are China (36.3%), India (12.9%),
            Brazil (11.9%) and Zimbabwe (3.5%). Globally in 2017, around 1.4
            billion people aged 15 years or older use tobacco (1.07 billion
            smokers and 367 million use smokeless tobacco) and the
            age-standardized global average prevalence of smoking. <br /><br />
